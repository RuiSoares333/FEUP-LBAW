# Super Legit Collaborative News (SLCN)
The Super Legit Collaborative News (SLCN) is a project with the main goal of free, open and accessible news sharing for and by users. 

This will allow users to share news on any topic, browse news with access to category filtering, comment and vote on any existing news item or comment.

Users will have access to a profile, housing their information, profile picture and news score. Here will also be a list of posted news and comments. They also will be able to follow other users, specific tags and categories and view their favorite items.

Along with regular users, the platform will employ administrators that moderate posts and users.

The platform will have adaptive, responsive design to allow usage on multiple devices (desktop, smartphone, etc) aswell as an intuitive user interface and navigation.
